The game file is main.py<br>

You may need to type ```pip install pygame``` first. <br>

Then, you can type ```python3 main.py```. If this do not work, you can try ```python main.py```<br>
Current available game state is "menu" and "story" only. There are many useless lines, as the file are modified version of the old verb conversion code. You can try to read it first though.
